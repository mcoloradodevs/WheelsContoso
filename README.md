A repository to store the source code of the Wheels Contoso solution; an app designed to make carpooling easier at work
## The solution
This is an application built on the Microsoft Power Platform; a set of tools to develop enterprise-grade solutions using low-code as a foundational principle. The solution uses Power Apps to develop and run the main UI, Dataverse to store all data and Power Automate to automate communications between drivers and passengers via Microsoft Teams
